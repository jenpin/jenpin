  I'm most comfortable in that weird, funky world between design and development—that's where the most fun, creative, boundary-breaking work happens. 
  I work at REA as a developer and have an ancient (3 year old site) - [theeconomicsocio] (https://www.theeconomicsocio.com/)


👀  I’m interested in  - Android development and love everything that's shiny and new! 

🌱  I’m currently learning -
 🛺  Kotlin and everything mobile. Love how the mobile is so different from the 🕸️ and how you can deliver amazing value in such a small screen.
 🧑‍🚀   SEO and how to market a product . Check me out on the gram  [#oatmeupbuttercup] (https://www.instagram.com/oatmeupbuttercup/)
